  Vagrant, VirtualBox, GHC sources and other black magic
* Concurrency and MVars with Haste.Concurrent
* Unboxed arrays, ByteArrays, StableNames and other low level features
* Low-level DOM base library
* Easy integration with Google's Closure compiler
* Works on Windows, GNU/Linux and Mac OS X


Installation
------------

You have three options for getting Haste: installing from Hackage, from
Github or from one of the pre-built
[binary packages](http://haste-lang.org/#downloads).
In the first two cases, you need to add add Cabal's bin directory, usually
`~/.cabal/bin`, to your `$PATH` if you haven't already done so.
When installing from the Mac, Windows or generic Linux package, you may want
to add `path/to/haste-compiler/bin` to your `$PATH`.
The Debian package takes care of this automatically.

Then, installing the latest stable-ish version from cabal is easy:

    $ cabal install haste-compiler
    $ haste-boot

Building from Github source is equally easy. After checking out the source,
`cd` to the source tree and run:

    $ cabal install
    $ haste-boot --force --local

When installing from GitHub, you should probably run the test suite first
though, to verify that everything is working. To do that, execute
`./runtests.sh` in the Haste root directory.  You may also run only a particular
test by executing `./runtests.sh NameOfTest`.  The test suite uses the `nodejs`
interpreter by default, but this may be modified by setting the `JS` environment
variable as such: `JS=other-js-interpreter ./runtests.sh`. Other JavaScript
interpreters may or may not work. `runtests.sh` isnâ€™t downloaded when installing
from Hackage. You would have to download it from GitHub.

To build the patched Closure compiler used when compiling using `--opt-minify`,
get the Closure source, apply `patches/closure-argument-removal.patch` and
build it as you normally would. This is not usually necessary however,
as `haste-boot` fetches a pre-compiled Closure binary when run.

Haste has been tested to work on Windows and OSX platforms, but is primarily
developed on GNU/Linux. As such, running on a GNU/Linux platform will likely
get you less bugs.


Portable installation
---------------------

It is possible to install Haste along with its runtime system and base
libraries into a portable directory.
Each user still has their own package database, which makes this handy
for global installations. To do this, check out the source and run:

    $ cabal configure -f portable
    $ cabal build

Building Haste this way yourself is not recommended however, as pre-booted
[binary packages](http://haste-lang.org/#downloads) built this way are
available for your convenience. Why jump through hoops if you don't have to?

A portable installation needs a working GHC install of the same version
that was used to build Haste available on your `$PATH`.

Be aware that a portable installation is **statically linked**, and thus
includes `libgmp`. This two things:

  * you will need the static `libgmp` libraries (`.a` files) to build, and
  * if you are distributing portable Haste binaries with proprietary
    modifications, *you are violating the LGPL license of libgmp*!
    If this is a problem for you, consider contributing your changes back to
    mainline Haste under the BSD3 license.


Usage
-----

To compile your Haskell program to a JavaScript blob ready to be included in an
HTML document or run using a command line interpreter:

    $ hastec myprog.hs

This is equivalent to calling ghc --make myprog.hs; Main.main will be called
as soon as the JS blob has finished loading.

You can pass the same flags to hastec as you'd normally pass to GHC:

    $ hastec -O2 -fglasgow-exts myprog.hs

Haste also has its own set of command line arguments. Invoke it with `--help`
to read more about them. In particular `--opt-all`, `--opt-minify`,
`--start` and `--with-js` should be fairly interesting.

If you want your package to compile with both Haste and, say, GHC, you might
want to use the CPP extension for conditional compilation. Haste defines the
preprocessor symbol `__HASTE__` in all modules it compiles. This symbol may
also be used to differentiate between Haste versions, since it is defined
as an integer representation of the current Haste version. Its format is
`MAJOR*10 000 + MINOR*100 + MICRO`. Version 1.2.3 would thus be represented as
10203, and 0.4.3 as 403.

Haste also comes with wrappers for cabal and ghc-pkg, named haste-cabal and
haste-pkg respectively. You can use them to install packages just as you would
with vanilla GHC and cabal:

    $ haste-cabal install mtl

This will only work for libraries, however, as installing JavaScript
"executables" on your system doesn't make much sense. You can still use
`haste-cabal build` to build your "executables" locally, however.

Finally, you can interact with JavaScript code using the FFI. See
`doc/js-externals.txt` for more information about that.

For more information on how Haste works, see
[the Haste Report](http://haste-lang.org/hastereport.pdf "Haste Report"),
though beware that parts of Haste may have changed quite a bit.

You should also have a look at the documentation and/or source code for
`haste-lib`, which resides in the `libraries/haste-lib` directory, and the
small programs in the `examples` directory, to get started.


Interfacing with JavaScript
---------------------------

When writing programs you will probably want to use some native JavaScript
in your program; bindings to native libraries, for instance. There are two ways
of doing this. You can either use the GHC FFI as described in
`doc/js-externals.txt`, or you can use the Fay-like `ffi` function:

    addTwo :: Int -> Int -> IO Int
    addTwo = ffi "(function(x, y) {return x + y;})"

The `ffi` function is a little bit safer than the GHC FFI in that it enforces
some type invariants on values returned from JS, and is more convenient. It is,
however, quite a bit slower due to its dynamic nature.

If you do not feel comfortable throwing out your entire legacy JavaScript
code base, you can export selected functions from your Haste program and call
them from JavaScript:

fun.hs:

    import Haste.Foreign
    import Haste.Prim (toJSStr)

    fun :: Int -> String -> IO String
    fun n s = return $ "The number is " ++ show n ++ " and the string is " ++ s

    main = do
      export (toJSStr "fun") fun

legacy.js:

    function mymain() {
      console.log(Haste.fun(42, "hello"));
    }

...then compile with:

    $ hastec '--start=$HASTE_MAIN(); mymain();' --with-js=legacy.js fun.hs

`fun.hs` will export the function `fun` when its `main` function is run.
Our JavaScript obviously needs to run after that, so we create our "real" main
function in `legacy.js`. Finally, we tell the compiler to start the program by
first executing Haste's `main` function (the `$HASTE_MAIN` gets replaced by
whatever name the compiler chooses for the Haste `main`) and then executing
our own `mymain`.


Effortless type-safe client-server communication
------------------------------------------------

Using the framework from the `Haste.App` module hierarchy, you can easily write
web applications that communicate with a server without having to write a
single line of AJAX/WebSockets/whatever. Best of all: it's completely type
safe.

In essence, you write your web application as a single program - no more forced
separation of your client and server code. You then compile your program once
using Haste and once using GHC, and the two compilers will magically generate
client and server code respectively.

You will need to have the same libraries installed with both Haste and vanilla
GHC (unless you use conditional compilation to get around this).
`haste-compiler` comes bundled with all of `haste-lib`, so you
only need to concern yourself with this if you're using third party libraries.
You will also need a web server, to serve your HTML and JS files; the binary
generated by the native compilation pass only communicates with the client part
using WebSockets and does not serve any files on its own.

Examples of Haste.App in action is available in `examples/haste-app` and
`examples/chatbox`.

For more information about how exactly this works, see this
[paper](http://haste-lang.org/haskell14.pdf).


Base library and documentation
------------------------------

You can build your own set of docs for haste-lib by running
`cabal haddock` in the Haste base directory as with any other package.

Or you could just look at
[the online docs](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haste-compiler).


Reactive web EDSL
-----------------

Fursuit, the reactive EDSL previously shipped together with Haste, had several
serious problems and has now been deprecated. Other, much better, solutions
which work with Haste include [Yampa](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Yampa),
[elerea](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/elerea) and others.


Libraries
---------

Haste is able to use standard Haskell libraries. However, some primitive
operations are still not implemented which means that any code making use
of them will give you a compiler warning, then die at runtime with an angry
error. Some libraries also depend on external C code - if you wish to use such
a library, you will need to port the C bits to JavaScript yourself (perhaps
using Emscripten) and link them into your program using `--with-js`.


Why yet another Haskell to JavaScript compiler?
-----------------------------------------------

Existing implementations either produce huge code, require a fair amount of
work to get going, or both. With Haste, the idea is to give you a drop-in
replacement for GHC that generates relatively lean code.


Known issues
------------

* Not all GHC primops are implemented; if you encounter an unimplemented
  primop, please report it together with a small test case that demonstrates
  the problem.

* Template Haskell is still broken.

* Generated code is not compatible with the vanilla Closure compiler's
  `ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS`, as it is not guaranteed to preserve
  `Function.length`.
  `haste-boot` bundles a compatibility patched version of Closure which does
  preserve this property. Invoking `hastec` with the `--opt-minify` option
  will use this patched version to minify the generated code with advanced
  optimizations.
