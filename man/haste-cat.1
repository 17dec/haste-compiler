.TH HASTE-CAT 1

.SH NAME
haste-cat \- inspect Haste intermediate code files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B haste-cat
.RI package-id:module-name

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B haste-cat
prints the intermediate Haste code for the given Haskell module to standard
output.

.BR
Package identifiers must be given with version numbers and package keys
(e.g. haste-prim-0.5.1.0-BtuKn3ytxKq6eTkR391Vdt as opposed to just haste-prim),
to avoid ambiguity in the face of multiple installed
versions of the same package.
GHC 7.8-based builds don't use package keys and so should be omitted.

See
.B haste-pkg list
for a list of installed packages and their corresponding versions.

.BR
If a package exists in more than one location, only the one first encountered
will be printed.
.B haste-cat
searches the following paths for installed packages, in this order.

.IP \[bu] 2
The current working directory
.IP \[bu] 2
Haste's user library directory
.IP \[bu] 2
Haste's system library directory
(where applicable; only portable installs have a separate system directory)
