This is a portable distribution of the Haste compiler.

It may be used as-is by giving the full path to hastec, haste-compiler, etc.
when executing them, or installed into your system's /usr/local directory
hierarchy.

To install Haste into /usr/local, run install.sh as root.
Haste may be uninstalled from /usr/local at any time using the uninstall.sh
script from this distribution as root, or from the
/usr/local/lib/haste-compiler directory to which it is copied during
installation.

---

Note that due to incompatibilities in the way Arch Linux handles locales,
this Haste distribution, like pre-built versions of many other applications,
may not be compatible with Arch Linux.

If you experience difficulties using this Haste distribution, please try
a source install instead; see http://haste-lang.org/downloads for source code
and build instructions.
