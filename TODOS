* Add user dirs for compiled libraries, and a compiler flag to install code
  into those dirs, as unlinked files, rather than link and dump to the current
  working dir.
  [nice to have/easy]

* Look into rewriting as much of the base libraries as possible in pure JS;
  huge space savings are likely!
  [nice to have/hard work]

* Implement tail call elimination using trampolining.
  [important/medium]

* Implement tail recursion as loops.
  [nice to have/easy after general tail calls]
