This is a slightly hacked copy of base from GHC 7.6.3.
This file sums up the differences.

* Implement Data.Typeable fingerprinting in Haskell/JS rather than C.
  (GHC.Fingerprint, GHC.IntWord64)
* Added module with Haste primitives. (GHC.HastePrim)
* Browser-native implementations of Show for Int, Integer, Double.
  (GHC.Show, GHC.Float)
* Fixes for primops that change type with host machine bitness.
  (GHC.Word, GHC.Int, GHC.Storable, GHC.Constants)
* Temporarily disable showEFloat, showGFloat and showFFloat until they can
  be fixed. (Numeric)
* Implement fromRational in JS, and get rid of its old helpers. (GHC.Float)
